# REST API AutomationFramework Intro
Even though there are several REST API Testing Frameworks available in the market today, they may not always suite your application, or may need modifications based on your requirements. This may call for the creation of your own rest testing framework.
We will be creating a simple Rest Testing Framework in Java and JUnit that could be used for any testing scenarios.
